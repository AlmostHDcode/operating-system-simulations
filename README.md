# operating-system-simulations

Simulations created in my operating systems class that simulate various functions of an operating system such as:
* Memory allocation
* Page allocation
* Job scheduling

All simulations have a manual and/or presentation to go along with it that go into detail about what the simulation is and how it works. All simulations were written in Java

### NOTE:
* there may be bugs, I wasn't able to get some of the simulations fully working during the allocted time of the class
